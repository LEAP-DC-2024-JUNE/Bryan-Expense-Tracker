# Expense and Income Tracker
This is a simple website that is designed to keep track of incomes and expenses. It displays them in a table and a chart.
This project is meant to be an application of some of the backend concepts I have learned.
Currently, there are still many bugs that needs to be fixed, aside from the bland appearance and structure.
Later on, I would like to user accounts and a login and signup feature, so that users can interact with only their expenses and incomes.
